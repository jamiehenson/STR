STR Readme 09/01/2013

New Git repository taken from the latest version of the niflhel one, and streamlined notably.

Essentially, it was damaged beyond repair with all the binary and temporary files lying
there that we couldn't get rid of. We can't just delete the files, you'd have to edit the
history of every single commit and that procedure wasn't successful.

So here we are!

Hope it all pans out well, folks!
